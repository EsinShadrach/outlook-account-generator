# Usage

-   Create and ENV!!
    ```powershell
    python3 -m venv env
    python3 -m venv [env_name]
    ```
-   Activate the env while in the directory where the project is
    ```powershell
    source [env_name]/bin/activate
    ```
-   Install packages from the requirements.txt
    ```powershell
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
-   navigate to [.src/config.py](./src/config.py) to change the number of accounts

    ```python
    config = {
      "number_of_accounts_to_generate": 10
    }
    ```

### now for the hard part ðŸ™‚

-   navigate to

    ```powershell
    [env_name]/lib/python3.10/site-packages/bose/download_driver.py
    ```

    and update the function `def download_driver():` to the following

    ```python
    def download_driver():
      build_dir = "build"

      if not os.path.exists(build_dir):
          os.makedirs(build_dir)

      major_version = get_major_version(get_chrome_version())
      print(f'[INFO] Downloading Driver for Chrome Version {major_version} in {build_dir}/ directory. This is a one-time process. Download in progress...')

      download_driver_in_path()
      move_driver()
    ```

that should fix any errors you might have concerning downloading of a driver for `chrome version 115` or above

### download a chrome driver

Note: `The chrome driver version you download should be the same as your chrome version` which you can check here [chrome://settings/help](chrome://settings/help)

My chrome version is `115.0.5790.170` and i use a Linux so i head on to here: https://edgedl.me.gvt1.com/edgedl/chrome/chrome-for-testing/115.0.5790.170/linux64/chromedriver-linux64.zip
to download a driver

After you're done hopefully inside build create a folder named the `Major version` of your chrome in my case it would be `build/115` then add the chromedriver to it making it `build/115/chromedriver`

That's all, note this is if you encounter an issue like this

```shell
(env) rafe@shadrach:~/codes/git codes/outlook-account-generator$ python main.py
